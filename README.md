Super Mario Video Game In Verilog
=================================

This game was first created by my partner and I for a final project for a Digital Systems 
course we took in our second year at the University of Toronto. It's similar to the classic
Super Mario Bros. but with a reverse psychology twist.

You would need an Altera DE2 Board and a monitor with VGA display to play it.
